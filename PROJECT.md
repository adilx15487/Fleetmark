## 1. Project Overview

**Fleetmark** is a full-stack smart transportation management platform designed for schools, universities, and enterprises. It provides seat reservation, fleet management, route planning, and real-time notifications — replacing chaotic manual processes with a clean, role-based digital system.

### Mission

> Eliminate overcrowded buses, unfair seat allocation, and poor route visibility by giving every stakeholder — admins, passengers, and drivers — the tools they need in one unified platform.

### Target Users

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| **Admin / Organizer** | Manages the entire fleet: buses, routes, schedules, users, and reports |
| **Passenger (Student / Employee)** | Reserves seats, views routes & schedules, receives notifications |
| **Driver** | Views assigned schedule, passenger manifests, and route details |

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| **Framework** | React 18 + TypeScript 5.6 |
| **Build Tool** | Vite 6.4 |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS v4 (`@tailwindcss/vite` plugin) |
| **Animations** | Framer Motion |
| **Icons** | Lucide React |
| **Charts** | Recharts |
| **Routing** | React Router DOM v6 |
| **Deployment** | Vercel (CI/CD on push) |
| **Package Manager** | npm |

| Deployment domain / SSL | DevOps | — |

### 📝 Notes & Decisions

- All dashboard pages use mock data from `src/data/mockData.ts` — swap to API calls when ready
- Using `vercel.json` rewrites for SPA client-side routing
- Recharts for all data visualization (bar, line, pie/donut)
- Sidebar collapses to icon-only mode on desktop, slides as drawer on mobile
- Auth section on landing page logs to console — will connect to real API
